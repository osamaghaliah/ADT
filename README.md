**Introduction:**
    _The project represents an adaptive array which is effectively constructed by dynamic allocation in C language._
    _Once opening the project in your IDE, a more-explained documentation exists in-between the coding lines that deeply illustrates how the data structure works._ 
    
**In order to run, perform the following commands in your terminal sequencely:**
  * make demo
  
      >_This command compiles the Demo.c program._

     >_This command runs the compiled program._
     
  * make mem_test
